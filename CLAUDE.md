# CLAUDE.md — Mi CV con IA

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repository.

## Product purpose

**Mi CV con IA** is a Spanish-language AI resume builder. It guides a user through
creating a truthful professional résumé by asking **adaptive** questions (not a
fixed script), inferring **evidence-backed** skills the user must confirm, and
generating a résumé that contains **only confirmed information**. A user with no
formal employment can still complete a résumé through education, projects,
volunteering, caregiving, entrepreneurship, or other transferable experience.

All user-facing text is **Spanish**. Structured data is normalized and stored in
English field names for code clarity.

> The source-of-truth design is a **Pencil file** (`aiCV.pen`). This repo is primarily
> the **backend + AI orchestration + server-rendered HTML/PDF résumé** (`app/api/*`),
> plus a **minimal working React UI** (`app/page.tsx`, `app/cv/[id]/page.tsx`,
> `app/login/page.tsx`, `components/*`) that consumes those APIs so the product is
> usable end-to-end. The UI is intentionally lean — a fuller build should follow the
> Pencil design.

## Architecture

Dependencies point downward; the domain never imports infrastructure.

```
middleware.ts  (online guard → brand resolution → Supabase session refresh)
   │
app/layout.tsx  (brand fonts + inlined :root theme + BrandProvider + header)
   │
app/api/*  (route handlers: auth → validate → service → typed JSON)
   │
lib/services/answer-pipeline.ts · lib/resume/resume-generator.ts · lib/skills/*
   │
lib/question-engine/*  (completeness-engine, question-catalog, prioritizer, planner)  ← PURE, no I/O
   │                                             │
lib/repositories/*  (Store interface)     lib/ai/*  (AIProvider: mock ⇆ azure)
   │                                             │
Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)          openai SDK → Azure OpenAI (server-only)
```

**Two-layer questioning:**
1. `completeness-engine.ts` (deterministic, no LLM) decides *which* sections/fields
   are eligible and computes the `CompletenessReport` + readiness.
2. `adaptive-planner.ts` picks and personalizes a question from catalog-derived
   candidates. `questionId`, `inputType`, `required`, `allowSkip`, and
   `nextAction` come from the **catalog**, never the model.

**Provider split (cost control):** the paid model always handles **résumé
generation + analysis** (`ai`, the end of the funnel and each regenerate). The
**funnel provider** (`getFunnelProvider()`, exposed as `funnelAi`) is cost-aware:
- `AI_PROVIDER=mock` → a pure `MockAIProvider` (offline, tests, zero tokens).
- `AI_PROVIDER=azure` → a `HybridAIProvider` (`lib/ai/hybrid-provider.ts`) that
  sends the *narrative* capture that most affects résumé quality to the model —
  `normalizeAnswer` for the rich sections (`experience`, `projects`, `languages`,
  `achievements`, `certifications`) and `extractInterests` — while keeping cheap
  ops (question planning, skill inference, simple-field normalization:
  name/contact/career goal/education) on the deterministic mock.

**The AI backend is Azure OpenAI** (`lib/ai/azure-openai-provider.ts`), reached with
the stock `openai` SDK pointed at the resource's **v1** endpoint
(`…/openai/v1`) — that surface speaks plain OpenAI wire format, so there is no
`api-version` parameter and no Azure-specific client. Requests use the **Responses**
API, the only surface the `*-codex` models are served on, and pass `store: false` so
the résumé text is not retained server-side. Cost is controlled per operation via
`reasoning.effort`: `none` for mechanical extraction (verified 0 reasoning tokens),
`high` for résumé generation, `medium` for the critique. Prompt caching is automatic
on this platform — no cache markers — which is why stable instructions go in
`instructions` and the variable input in `input`.

Because prompts drive model output shape, any prompt that returns JSON must
enumerate the **exact** schema field names + enum values (see
`buildResumeGenerationPrompt` / `buildNormalizerPrompt`); the corresponding Zod
schemas add a tolerant `z.preprocess` for common container-name drift
(`id`→`entryId`, `skills`→`skillIds`, `extractedData`→`updates`). Reasoning tokens
count against `max_output_tokens`, so funnel/generation calls use generous ceilings
to avoid truncation, and a truncated reply is retried with *more* room rather than
the same ceiling.

### Key modules

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `types/` | Domain model + `ResumeProfileState` (model-safe, PII-redacted) |
| `lib/env.ts` | Zod-validated, `server-only` config. Secrets never reach the client |
| `lib/brand/` | multi-brand system: configs · registry · pure host resolution · `:root` theme emitter · server/client accessors |
| `components/marketing/` | branded surfaces: shared hero + per-brand headers, dispatched via a registry |
| `lib/repositories/` | `Store` interface + `MemoryStore` (dev/tests) + `SupabaseStore` |
| `lib/profile-state.ts` | Assembles `ResumeProfileState`, redacts PII, computes completeness |
| `lib/question-engine/` | completeness · catalog · prioritizer · adaptive planner |
| `lib/ai/` | `AIProvider` abstraction, `MockAIProvider`, `AzureOpenAIProvider`, prompts, **Zod schemas** |
| `lib/skills/` | evidence-backed inference + confirm/reject/edit lifecycle |
| `lib/services/answer-pipeline.ts` | the spec §9 answer pipeline |
| `lib/resume/` | generator · HTML renderer · PDF (puppeteer) · source tracing · **analyzer** (improvement loop) · **proofreader** (final spelling/grammar/format pass before finalize) |
| `lib/analytics/` | Amplitude (HTTP API) with PII allow-list; no-op when unconfigured |
| `lib/services/funnel-telemetry.ts` | Records a question as *shown* (event + `QuestionState.lastShownQuestionId`) so funnel exit points are visible — see `docs/funnel-analytics.md` |
| `supabase/migrations/` | SQL schema + RLS |

## Brand system (multi-brand, one repo)

The app serves **two marketing brands from one build**: `aprende-plus` (warm,
learner-facing) and `aprende` (Aprende Institute — formal, institutional). See
`docs/branding.md` for the full design; the rules that constrain code:

- **Only marketing is branded.** Palette, typography, header, landing hero,
  metadata and marketing copy. The funnel, question engine, AI orchestration,
  `Store` and analytics are shared and brand-agnostic. **The generated résumé is
  deliberately NOT themed** — it is the user's document, so
  `lib/resume/resume-renderer.ts` keeps its own neutral print palette.
- **The brand is chosen from the request host**, resolved once in `middleware.ts`
  and stamped on `x-brand`. Precedence: `?brand=` → cookie →
  `BRAND_HOST_OVERRIDES` → host match → `DEFAULT_BRAND` → `aprende-plus`.
  `lib/brand/resolve.ts` is pure and holds the rules. The brand gates styling and
  copy only — never data access, never a permission.
- **`BrandConfig` is pure, serializable data** (`lib/brand/brands/*.ts`): no React,
  no `next/*`, no `server-only`, no I/O. That is what lets edge middleware,
  Server Components and Client Components all read the same object. Per-brand
  *components* are registered separately in `components/marketing/registry.tsx`,
  so configs never depend on the UI layer.
- **`tailwind.config.ts` contains no brand colours.** Every token resolves to
  `rgb(var(--c-…) / <alpha-value>)`, filled in by the `:root` block that
  `app/layout.tsx` inlines. Adding a brand touches no CSS and no shared component.
- **Tokens are semantic, not literal** — `accent`, `text-primary`, `border`; never
  `coral` or `plum`. Product components must use only semantic tokens. The literal
  values (`brand-strong`, `brand-mark`, `brand-support`) are for the marketing
  layer alone.
- **Contrast is enforced, not hoped for.** `tests/unit/brand-theme.test.ts` asserts
  WCAG AA (4.5:1) for every registered brand. Two inherited Aprende+ values sit
  below AA and are *pinned* as documented exceptions rather than silently changed.
- **Reuse first, fork deliberately.** Prefer a shared config-driven component with
  a layout variant (`MarketingHero` serves both brands). Register a per-brand
  component only when one component would need a flag per visual decision (the two
  headers). A registered component must be presentational — `brand` as a prop, no
  server APIs.
- **Adding a brand** = a config file + one line in `lib/brand/registry.ts` + fonts
  in `app/fonts.ts` + assets in `public/brands/<id>/`. `BrandId` is derived from the
  registry keys, so every `Record<BrandId, …>` becomes a compile error until the new
  brand is handled. The brand tests then cover it automatically.

## Coding conventions

- TypeScript `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. `tsc --noEmit` must pass.
- Domain field names are English camelCase; user-facing strings are Spanish.
- Route handlers stay thin: resolve context → validate body (Zod) → call a
  service → return via `ok`/`created`. Wrap bodies in `handleRoute` for consistent
  error envelopes: `{ data }` on success, `{ error: { code, message, details? } }` on error.
- Services accept dependencies (`store`, `ai`, `analytics`) as parameters (DI) so
  they are testable without Next/Supabase.
- Never import `lib/env`, `lib/supabase`, `lib/ai` (index), or `lib/analytics`
  from pure domain code — they are `server-only`. Pure engines import only `types`.

## Safety rules (enforced in CODE, not just prompts)

- Inferred skills are **always** created with status `suggested`; only an explicit
  user action makes them `confirmed`/`edited` (`lib/skills/`).
- Résumé generation reads only `confirmed`/`edited` skills and
  `confirmed`/`edited` entries; every generated bullet is **source-traced** and
  untraceable model output is dropped (`lib/resume/source-tracing.ts`).
- Prohibited inferences (leadership/management without evidence, language fluency,
  suggestions without evidence) are filtered in `isProhibitedSuggestion`.
- Approximate values are preserved verbatim; raw user wording is kept
  (`ConversationTurn.userAnswer`, `ExperienceEntry.rawDescription`).
- All AI output is validated with Zod before use (`lib/ai/schemas.ts`); the model
  can never return code/SQL/HTML through these shapes.
- Analytics never receives raw answers/PII — only allow-listed keys
  (`lib/analytics/events.ts`).
- We never request or store age, photo, marital status, religion, race, health,
  SSN, or immigration status.

## Database rules

- Every table has **RLS** enabled; a user can only touch rows under their own
  `resume_profiles`. `SupabaseStore` relies on RLS as defense-in-depth.
- Domain code touches the DB only through the `Store` interface — never raw SQL.
- The service-role key bypasses RLS and is **server-only** (used only for user
  provisioning). Schema changes go in a new `supabase/migrations/NNNN_*.sql`.

## AI factuality requirements

See `lib/ai/prompts.ts` → `SYSTEM_FACTUALITY` (used on every résumé-related call).
Use only user-provided/confirmed facts; never invent employers, titles, dates,
degrees, certifications, tools, or metrics; ask a follow-up when a critical fact
is missing; improve wording without changing meaning; return valid JSON only.

## Testing expectations

- **Unit** (`tests/unit/`, Vitest): completeness, prioritization, no-repeat/skip,
  skill status/confirm/reject, prohibited inference, readiness, generation from
  confirmed-only data, no-invented-facts, AI schema validation, analytics scrubbing,
  brand resolution precedence, and per-brand palette completeness + WCAG contrast.
- **E2E** (`tests/e2e/`, Playwright): the seven flows in spec §19, driven through
  the API against a production build in mock/memory mode.
- Always mock the AI provider in tests (`MockAIProvider`) — it obeys the same
  safety invariants and validates its own output against the shared Zod schemas.
- `tsc --noEmit`, `vitest run`, and `playwright test` must all pass before done.

## Commands

```bash
npm install                # install deps
npm run dev                # dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build && npm start  # production build + serve
npm run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
npm test                   # unit tests (vitest)
npm run test:e2e           # e2e tests (playwright; builds + starts the app)
npm run lint               # next lint
```

**Online-only:** this app cannot run offline. `AI_PROVIDER=mock` and
`PERSISTENCE=memory` are rejected at startup (`ONLINE_ONLY` in `lib/env.ts`), and
a runtime connectivity guard (`lib/connectivity.ts`, wired into `middleware.ts`)
returns **503** on every request when the host has no network. You must set
`AI_PROVIDER=azure` (+ `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL`) and
`PERSISTENCE=supabase` (+ Supabase URL/keys) — see `.env.example`. PDF export
requires `puppeteer` (installed). Note: this intentionally breaks the mock/memory-based
unit + e2e tests as written (flip `ONLINE_ONLY` to `false` to restore offline test runs).

## Configuration (env)

All via environment variables; never commit secrets. See `.env.example`.
`AI_PROVIDER`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY`, `PERSISTENCE`,
`DEFAULT_BRAND`, `BRAND_HOST_OVERRIDES`.

## Out of scope (do not add in milestone 1)

Job applications, job matching, cover letters, interview simulation, LinkedIn
publishing, and decorative multi-template themes. (A minimal React UI + Supabase
email/password auth now exist; a polished, design-faithful UI is future work.
Note: the **brand** system is not a "theme" system — it swaps marketing identity
per host, not résumé templates, which remain single and neutral.)
